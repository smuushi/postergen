goal:

react frontend will allow users to paste a movie script or movie movie description.. 

taking that text, it will prompt openai for an image generation which will be saved to an S3 bucket automatically from the frontend for persisting the image.. no need to design a backend api or use database keys. s3 can stay public so that anyone with the link will always access it.
